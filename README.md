# ðŸ’€ Codes:

There is always a pattren that emerges when you do something repeatedly, well here are the pattrens some of the top algorithms such as divide and conquer,
BFS, DFS.... Etc

So I thought to include some basic skelton codes for such repeated algorithms to get started and use them on the go by modifying according to the problems.

Let's get started..
